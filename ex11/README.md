# Censorship

You are given a file of words to censor. Then you are given a document file. You will need to replace a censored word with the same number of ‘\*’ as the length of the word.

The result of censored document is printed to STDOUT:

```
./ex11.exe censor.dat document.txt

this is ******* cool!
```

**NOTE:** Treat the text case-insensitively when censoring. Do not change the words that are not censored.
